\section{Introduction to ARMvisor}
\subsection{What is ARMvisor}

ARMvisor is a virtual machine on ARM architecture. ARMvisor is based on Kernel-based Virtual Machine. ARMvisor have been developed from 2009. Because ARM architecture doesnâ€™t  support virtualization in hardware instruction set until 2011, ARMvisor is para-virtualized virtual machine.

\begin{figure}[h]  % Put pictures here.
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{armvisor_archi.png}
\caption{Overview of ARMvisor} 
\label{armvisor_archi}
\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{armvisor_archi}, we can observe the architecture of ARMvisor. On the bottom, it is ARM-based hardware. Above the hardware, it's Host OS's kernel which include ARMvisor. Because ARMvisor is a part of Linux kernel, if you want to use ARMvisor, you have to use the kernel with ARMvisor. You can use our pre-compiled kernel image which will be introduced in the following section. If you want to compile the kernel by yourself which will also introduced in another following section.

In the user space of host OS, we need to use QEMU to provide the user to create and manage the VM. Besides, QEMU will also emulate I/O device for Guest OS. If you want to use ARMvisor, you have to use the QEMU modified by us. You can use our pre-compiled QEMU image which will be introduced in the following section. If you want to compile modified QEMU by yourself which will also introduced in another following section. Otherwise, if you want to boot the Guest OS, you can need to give QEMU some parameters to run QEMU in KVM mode. You can use your own parameters to boot. You can also choose the script file provided by us. We will introduce how to use our script to boot Guest OS in the following section.

In the Guest OS, you need to use the special kernel which patched by us. Because our model is para-virtualization. You need to use patched kernel of the Guest OS. As a result, if you want to use ARMvisor, you have to use the patched kernel of the Guest OS. You can use our pre-compiled patched kernel image of the Guest OS which will be introduced in the following section. If you want to compile the patched kernel of the Guest OS by yourself which will also introduced in another following section.

\subsection{How to use ARMvisor}

You can run ARMvisor on the most of standard ARMv6/ARMv7 hardware. In following section, 
%we choose two platforms, QEMU and TI BeagleBoard, to show that how to use ARMvisor.
we choose QEMU to show that how to use ARMvisor.

\section{Use ARMvisor on QEMU}
For those who don't have real ARM-based device but still want to use ARMvisor, this section is what you should read!

In this section, we will introduce that how to use QEMU to emulate ARM device on your x86-based PC. Then, we will also show that how to run the pre-compiled host OS on your QEMU on your x86-based PC. Finally, we will introduce that how to put the pre-compiled Guest OS into the root file system of the Host OS and how to run the Guest OS. Just like the Figure~\ref{armvisor_archi_qemu}.

\begin{figure}[h]  % Put pictures here.
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{armvisor_archi_qemu.png}
\caption{Overview of ARMvisor in the hardware emulated by QEMU}
\label{armvisor_archi_qemu}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to use QEMU to run the Host OS?}
QEMU is a tool to emulate ARM device on x86 PC. For those who don't have real ARM-based device but still want to use ARMvisor, QEMU provides you a emulated ARM device running on your PC. In following sections, we will introduce that how to get QEMU and how to use QEMU to run the Host OS.

\subsubsection{How to get QEMU to run the Host OS?}
If you use Ubuntu/Debian on your PC, you could get QEMU from \texttt{apt-get}. If you use Fedora on your PC, you could get QEMU from \texttt{yum}. If your package management system doesn't include QEMU, you can also download the source code from QEMU website (http://wiki.qemu.org/Main\_Page) and compile it by yourself.\newline\newline
For Ubuntu/Debian user:\newline
\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ sudo apt-get install qemu-system}}

\subsubsection{How to get the kernel image of Host OS?}
You can download our pre-compilied kernel image of the Host OS (https://github.com/SSLab-NTHU/linux-host-armvisor/raw/master/arch/arm/boot/zImage).\newline
\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ mkdir \~/armvisor}}\newline
\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ mkdir \~/armvisor/kernel-host}}\newline
\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ cd \~/armvisor/kernel-host}}\newline
\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ wget http://tinyurl.com/93yrxuj}}\newline

\subsubsection{How to get the root file system of Host OS?}
We don't provide the root file system of Host OS for you. You may reference Linaro website (https://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/DevPlatform/Rootfs) to try to build your root file system.  If you want to build your root file system in the way you want, such as reference the Debian website or Fedora website, it is still available.

\subsubsection{How to run the Host OS?}
You can boot the Host OS by setting some parameters of QEMU. You can also the booting script provided by us (https://github.com/SSLab-NTHU/boot-host-script/raw/master/run-host.sh) to boot the Host OS.\newline
\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ cd \~/armvisor/}}\newline
\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ wget https://github.com/SSLab-NTHU/boot-host-script/raw/master/run-host.sh}}\newline
You could modify the script for fitting your demands.

\subsection{Put the Guest OS into the Root File System of the Host OS}
Undoubtedly, the Guest OS, which include its kernel and root file system, needs to be put into the Root File System of the Host OS. Besides, because you need to use modified QEMU to create and manage VM, you also need to put the modified QEMU into the Root File System of the Host OS.

There are several way to put the Guest OS and modified QEMU into the Root File System of the Host OS. You could mount the image file of the Root File System on your PC and put the Guest OS and modified QEMU into the Root File System of the Host OS. You could also use Network File System (a.k.a. NFS) to communicate between the folder on PC and the folder in the Root File System of the Host OS. In the following sections, we will introduce how to get the Guest OS and how to put the Guest OS into the Root File System of the Host OS via NFS.

\subsubsection{How to get the Guest OS?}
You could download the pre-compiled kernel image of the Guest OS from the website ( https://github.com/SSLab-NTHU/linux-guest-armvisor/raw/master/arch/
arm/boot/zImage ).\newline
\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ mkdir \~/armvisor/kernel-guest}}\newline
\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ cd \~/armvisor/kernel-guest}}\newline
\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ wget http://tinyurl.com/9p52286}}

\subsubsection{How to set NFS?}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Before we set up for NFS, we need to install some packages.

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server uml-utilities}}

\item Download the Script provided by us

QEMU will create the script file called as ``qemu-ifup'' and ``qemu-ifdown'' in \texttt{/etc}. When QEMU is executed and want to access network, QEMU will execute this script file. We can use this file to modify the network setting of QEMU.

You could download script codes provided by us from the website ( \newline https://github.com/SSLab-NTHU/qemu-net-script/raw/master/qemu-ifup\newline and https://github.com/SSLab-NTHU/qemu-net-script/raw/master/qemu-ifdown ).

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ cd \~/armvisor}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ wget http://tinyurl.com/99qf44m}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ wget http://tinyurl.com/8t2sz3y}}

You need to change these scripts' mode into executable and use them to replace ordinary one.

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ sudo chmod u+x qemu-ifup}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ sudo chmod u+x qemu-ifdown}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ sudo mv qemu-ifup /etc/}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ sudo mv qemu-ifdown /etc/}}

\item Set up the NFS
So far, we have everything that we need to use NFS. We just only have to modify some configurations. We will create a folder which can be accessed by NFS server. Meanwhile, we will also set up the network to let that the network subsystem of the Ubuntu on PC can accept the connection from QEMU.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a folder as the NFS folder

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ mkdir \~/armvisor/nfs}}

\item Add the following words into \texttt{/etc/exports}

\fbox{\small{/home/username/armvisor/nfs 192.168.16.0/24(rw,async,no\_root\_squash,no\_subtree\_check)}}
\fbox{\small{/home/username/armvisor/nfs localhost(rw,async,no\_root\_squash,no\_subtree\_check)}}

\item Add the following words into \texttt{/etc/hosts.allow} to open the connection for NFS

\fbox{\small{nfsd:ALL
portmap:ALL
mountd:ALL}}

\item Let NFS server reload the configuration

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ sudo /etc/init.d/portmap restart}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart}}

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Put the Guest OS into NFS folder}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Change directory into the NFS folder

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ cd \~/armvisor/nfs}}

\item Download the pre-compiled modified QEMU for running the Guest OS 

You can get the pre-compiled modified QEMU from the website ( https://github.com/SSLab-NTHU/qemu-guest-armvisor/raw/master/arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm ).

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ cd \~/armvisor/nfs}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ wget http://tinyurl.com/8bhuwtq}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ mv 8bhuwtq qemu-system-arm}}

\item Download the pre-compiled kernel image of the Guest OS

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ cd \~/armvisor/nfs}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ wget http://tinyurl.com/9p52286}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ mv 9p52286 zImage-guest}}

\item Write a booting script for running the Guest OS

Use \texttt{vim} to create ``run-guest.sh'' which include the words in below:

\fbox{\small sudo qemu-system-arm -M realview-eb -cpu arm1136 -kernel zImage-guest -initrd guestfs.gz \\}
\fbox{\small -nographic -enable-kvm -append "console=ttyAMA0"}

Then change its mode into executable

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ chmod u+x run-guest.sh}}

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Run the Host OS and Guest OS}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Run the Host OS

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ cd \~/armvisor}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ ./run-host.sh}}

\item Mount NFS folder

After the host has already been in the shell, you can mount the NFS folder to get the files of the Guest OS

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ mount -t nfs 192.168.16.1:/home/username/armvisor/nfs /mnt}}

\item Run the Guest OS

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ cd /mnt}}

\fbox{\texttt{\small \$ ./run-guest.sh}}

\end{enumerate}

%\section{Use ARMvisor on TI BeagleBoard}
